There are always problems with enrollments, particularly for PhD students since the process is more complicated. These issues have increased exponentially with the change in student management system recently.
There have been major issues with my fees this year in particular where I have had to shoulder the work of tracking down what the exact errors are and re-applying for fees, even though the errors are totally the fault of Massey University. This has been extremely stressful. 
Communication from Massey about these technical issues with Massey's administrative systems has been non-existent (I only got a response about the fees issue when I got my supervisors involved), and inadequate. The system still seems to not be fixed, but I have had to step away from the issue as I move toward finishing my PhD. Administrative issues have always been significant sources of stress for me throughout my entire time as a student at Massey.

The most challenging ones that I have encountered is the expectations of studying full time and treating it like a full-time job when the financial support is not there from Studylink.

There is the saying that money doesn't buy happiness but I would argue it provides security which leads to the conditions for happiness.

For example, it is difficult to thrive as a student without taking part-time work, particularly if you do not have any family support (financial or material) and are living away from home. Part-time work also offers a good way to build skills, including social and professional skills, learn to get on with others in a workplace environment, and builds confidence. For example, since I have already successfully applied for and been chosen for employment, I am not as anxious about my ability to present myself as a good candidate in interviews, write a CV and cover letter, etc. I have some idea of my worth as an employee and how to demonstrate that. Whereas, had I not had part-time employment, I think I would be very worried at the end of my degree about getting a job - more worried than I am now. However, lecturers usually expect you (or seem to expect you) to be always prioritising your studies, and that just isn't always feasible, particularly when there are times when there are 6 assignments due at once, and other times when there is nothing due, but your work hours stay the same the whole time. In addition, it is important to spend time with family, networking, and building relationships, and sometimes it is easy to feel that if you have spent any time out with friends or family, and then don't get the best mark on an assignment, that you could have done better by spending more time on it.",1,1,0,1,2,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,2,0,2,0,0,1,2,0,0,,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,3,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,45,45,45,10,0,18,4,14,1,2,1,2,2

However, when I joined my research group I was given the challenge of developing my PhD research proposal which involved techniques from food engineering. I was honest enough to tell my supervisor that mathematics was my weakest point and I had never done engineering or physics. As I tried my best to understand and develop these skills, the students in my group, as well as my supervisor would laugh at my mistakes. I felt that I was harshly judged, ridiculed. It hindered my progress for a while.

There was also a person who was very rude to me and would often speak to me in a harsh manner. I felt that I was being humiliated by this person in front of everyone. I felt that I was made to feel uncomfortable and unwelcome in this research group.  It was very hard to make friends with anyone. Another challenge I faced was having access to equipment for my experiment. This was crucial for my confirmation.

Despite the challenges I faced, I found people who helped me with my calculations and with my experiments. I was determined to learn a new skill and to use this new knowledge and new skill to make a difference in my country. I have come a long way since when I arrived in 2017. I am proud of the graceful manner in which I handled the hostility towards me. At the end of the day people who were challenging showed me what I never want to become towards other people.

It was an unexpected and an unpleasant experience at first but it taught me how to work among challenging people and I was able to learn about emotional intelligence and soft skills needed to work with people apart from scientific knowledge and skills. This experience also taught me resilience and showed me how resilient I truly am.

It definitely makes you think about what you want to do with your life but then also deters you from the things you truly love due to non constructive criticism from lecturers. I find myself and others have a hard time when lecturers decide that their point of view is the most important thing rather than assisting and giving proper critic which in turn causes a lot of conflict within yourself because they tell you that you should be yourself and develop your skills to make your skills shine through but then if someone's personal preferences are a key point in order to get a passing grade then it causes a lot of stress, worry and confusion which often results in compromising and losing passion and interest.",3,2,1,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,2,1,0,0,2,2,0,,3,0,1,0,3,1,0,2,2,2,3,3,3,2,0,2,3,2,0,1,1,33,33,33,30,6,32,12,24,1,5,1,4,2

I feel I have wasted so much money and time on papers I now cannot use.

Block courses are really expensive to attend and we cannot get these paid for by course-related costs on our student loans. 

Campuses are not near airports and are difficult to get to, and Uni does nothing to support. Uni accomodation is almost never available.

We used to be able to order printed copies of course resources, but now we cannot, as a dyslexic learner I really need paper copies and so spend a huge amount printing them all out from the online environment.

It would be so nice if we could attend lectures online in real time down at the Waikto uni or nearest uni rather than trapsing from one end of the country to the other.

Having a wider offerring for exams - use other ui campuses would mean we can take papers when it fits in to our calendar.

Having student course reviews available to see BEFORE you select a paper would be so much more helpful, there is a huge ammount of variance between lecturers and papers, if one has a massive workload - it would be good to know that ahead of time.

Forums as an assessment tool just add so much stress to busy working people. We need the flexibility to work around our lives, and having to go into forums on a regular basis as part of grading is so stressful.

Not being able to meet with peopel in person to sort out issues is awful.

This led to me needing to figure out a new routine for the activities (yoga, exercise, cooking etc) I had been doing to relieve anxiety - which took nearly a whole semester to figure out and affected my ability to time manage effectively and my academic performance during this time was poor.

Finding a part-time job where the hours both complimented my course timetable (including being flexible enough to change my work hours as the course timetable change with each semester), and the hours per week were not too many (as to give me time to properly work on assignments), and that I wasn't considered ""over qualified"" for (due to previous work experience).

Getting used to the overall lifestyle change with going back to study after having worked full time for several years - things like having a smaller budget, needing to pre-prep meals to keep in freezer as I no longer have time to cook every night.

Having to change GP's due to my former GP's clinic being too far to get to frequently from uni, consequently registering with the Massey Wellington clinic (for convenience and price) only to not be able to see the same GP each time.

It has been challenging to have inconsistency as to which courses provide a marking schedule for assignments, or not.

I have 4 auto-immune disorders which have for the past 9 years prevented me from being in employment. I started to study, as a way to still use my brain and do something (as I cannot sit around doing nothing), but in the last couple of years I have figured out what I want to do next career-wise and am focusing my future study plans on these areas. That being said, it all depends on whether my health will improve enough to be able to do full-time study (I just tried this semester and had to drop a paper as I couldn't cope). Sometimes this makes me feel frustrated, and left behind. I haven't achieved some of the expected life goals like having a partner and children, as I am mostly confined to my four walls. This causes me some anxiety as my biological clock is fast running out, however I put my trust in God that there is a plan for my life and it will all work out. I have found purpose through studying, through going through grief counselling, and self-help courses to re-evaluate my life and see that the illnesses happened for a reason. I used to be deeply clinically depressed, but the illness afforded me the time to stop, rest, and begin the healing journey, and I have worked really hard to break through limiting beliefs that left me hopeless, vulnerable, and suicidal. I am proud to say that I am no longer depressed, and I have hope, purpose, and meaning in my life, despite not having achieved all that I want to ... yet.
I also help my aging parents with their errands, and cooking meals etc which cuts into the time and energy I have to study and achieve my goals. Sometimes I feel a little trapped, as my siblings with their families, are overseas so the onus is on me to care for our parents. Yet, I too have goals beyond this limited existence. But I am also grateful that I get quality time with my parents, and that I can help them.

Some supervisors are just not available and do not make time for you, so you feel undervalued and that you are not worth their time. It is hard when they are meant to support and guide you as the experts, and you end up feeling inadequate and lost. If they just managed their time better and made themselves available then it would not give rise to such feelings of not being worth their effort and/or time. 
I have worked in many professional environments and have never had such difficulties with trying to communicate with “senior” staff. They need to function as supervisors and actually guide the students, it is a time inefficient process for the student to not have clear direction, all it takes is regular discussions (at their time) to achieve this. This seriously affects my (and I know others) satisfaction with my time as a doctoral student, and it reflects directly back on Massey when I discuss this with friends, family and colleagues. I know I am not alone.

I felt like I hadnt learnt anything and I wasnt particularly keen on my major anymore (economics). I chose to continue on to a Masters (in a field that more aligns with my passion). The first semester of Masters hit me hard. I was a walking zombie. I was alone. I didnt know what I was doing. I felt stupid. It was a rough few months. At the end of semester one it was take a break from Masters but not be in the right headspace for a full-time job or become part-time. So that is what I have chosen. I work two part-time jobs, especially so because postgraduate students do not get student allowance and I couldnt imagine adding more to my loan through loan living costs. I am glad that I dont get student allowance because that probably would have stopped me from stepping back and taking a break. University is so overrated. It felt like regurgitation to me of ancient theories and principles being taught by lecturers who have been doing it for 30 years and havent updated the course material in years. I can say Massey failed me as a student.",2,3,2,2,1,1,3,1,0,0,3,3,2,1,1,1,2,0,0,0,1,1,0,,3,0,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,35,35,35,16,8,24,5,28,1,3,2,3,2

Seeing university as a worthwhile endeavour (both academically and financially) has been increasingly difficult. 
I find it difficult to enjoy some of the courses I do; some I have utterly disliked -- it mist be added that because of recent changes to qualification requirements and etc., I have been forced to choose courses i would have otherwise avoided, and some of the courses I would have liked to do were unavailable to distance students or they were made unavailable due to the fact that my BA is under 2015 rules. 
At the beginning of this year, I was treated like an inconvenience, an annoyance, and an idiot by a high ranking administrative staff member in charge of the system change-over who even tried to get me to choose courses for her convenience rather than my study preference.  
Early on in my studies, I looked at applying for scholarships but found that as I was white, male, and not impoverished, most of the scholarships were either unavailable to me or they technically were but preference would be given to people who were not white, male, and unimpoverished -- this is despite my ""Excelling"" academic standing at the time.

More video based lessons like say Lynda.com, which i use extensively to do learning will help.
